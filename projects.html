    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <h2 id="description">JAVA OOP</h2>
    <p id="description">I have built many small projects in java, one of the bigger projects was Candy shop. The program was a final project for our class and a team assignment. I have lead the project and organized the work load in order to divide the work efficiently. Building the program taught me to effectively work with many classes in java and objects, and the resulting in the grade 94/100. From the IT classes I took, Java concentrated classes was particularly interesting to me, especially IT 206, IT 207, and IT 106, These classes were program implementation heavy and had many labs and projects to build. Starting from the basic I have learned how to plan and implement java projects. </p>
