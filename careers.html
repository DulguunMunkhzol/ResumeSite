    <h1>Career plans</h1>
    <p id="career">I have an avid urge to do interesting things and loves to learn. 
        In many cases I love to build or solve puzzle, so to utilize these character traits, I plan to become a software engineer
    <br>There are many different kinds of companies out there that I would love to join, but if I were to pick one
    I would pick rockstar games, they make fun games such as gta5 and other interesting projects</p>
